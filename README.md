## The **'easy'** way!  

<br>


1. Go to the **[Github website][github]**, create an account and login. But of course you already have an account, riiiight?!

2. On your Github dashboard, **click on the "+" button** in the top right corner and select **"New repository"**.

3. Give your repository a name like **"username.github.io"**, but replace **"username"** with your actual **Github username**. Make sure to select the option to make the repository public.

4. Now, open a blank text file on your computer and write the content you want to include on your website. Save the file as "index.html" and make sure it is saved in a folder on your computer.

1. Go back to your Github repository page and click on the "Upload files" button. Then, drag and drop your "index.html" file into the file upload area.

1. Once your file is uploaded, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Commit changes" button.

1. Your website should now be live at "username.github.io". If you go to that website in your web browser, you should see the content you wrote in the "index.html" file.

1. To make changes to your website, just edit the "index.html" file on your computer and repeat steps 5-7 to upload the new version of the file to Github.

## The **'imma boss'** way!

1. Create a new repository on Github with a name like "username.github.io", where "username" is your Github username.  

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to store your website files.  

3. Create a new folder for your website and navigate into it.  

4. Create an index.html file with your website content using your preferred text editor.  

5. Initialize a Git repository in the root folder of your website by running the command git init.  

6. Add your website files to the repository by running the command git add . (the "." indicates that you want to add all the files in the current directory).  

7. Commit your changes by running the command git commit -m "Initial commit".  

8. Push your changes to Github by running the command git push origin main.
Visit your website at "username.github.io" in your web browser to confirm that it is live.
