Testing site for technology assignment. This is will be a guide for setting up a website hosted with github pages.


## Guide if you're 5 years old

1. First, go to the Github website and create an account if you don't already have one. Once you have an account, log in.

2. On your Github dashboard, click on the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository".

3. Give your repository a name like "username.github.io", but replace "username" with your actual Github username. Make sure to select the option to make the repository public.

4. Now, open a blank text file on your computer and write the content you want to include on your website. Save the file as "index.html" and make sure it is saved in a folder on your computer.

5. Go back to your Github repository page and click on the "Upload files" button. Then, drag and drop your "index.html" file into the file upload area.

6. Once your file is uploaded, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Commit changes" button.

7. Your website should now be live at "username.github.io". If you go to that website in your web browser, you should see the content you wrote in the "index.html" file.

8. To make changes to your website, just edit the "index.html" file on your computer and repeat steps 5-7 to upload the new version of the file to Github.
